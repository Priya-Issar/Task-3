# Task-3

MIDAS@IIITD Summer Internship/RA Task 2021

## Task 3: NLP
**Problem Statement**- Use a given dataset to build a model to predict the category using description. Write code in python.

link of dataset-
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pLv0fNE4WHokpJHUIs-FTVnmI9STgog05e658qEON0I/edit?usp=sharing

1. Show how you would clean and process the data

2. Show how you would visualize this data

3. Show how you would measure the accuracy of the model

4. What ideas do you have to improve the accuracy of the model? What other algorithms would you try?

### How to run the code

In order to run the code open the ipynb file on Google Colaboratory

link of dataset used-
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pLv0fNE4WHokpJHUIs-FTVnmI9STgog05e658qEON0I/edit?usp=sharing

1.Upload the dataset on google drive and then mount the drive to use the dataset in the given ipynb notebook

2.Mount the drive

3.Copy the path of the given dataset file

4.write the following code in the notebook

        df = pd.read_csv('path') #in path, write the copied path of the dataset will come
